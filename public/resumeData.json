    "bio": "Since I was young, I was always fascinated by the day-to-day evolving technology. During high school, I came across an opportunity to pick up programming as a elective, which by far turned out to be the most fun subject. I loved making the programs work the way I wanted to and coming up with fun and creative designs for the front end of my applications. Since then, I have had a growing interest in software engineering, digital designing and learning new ways to code and create unique applications. I have always enjoyed learning new things and am constantly seeking out new learning opportunities. My biggest ambition is to one day have a chance to work on an application that will help improve people's lives on a global scale.",
